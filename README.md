# Branding for a NMFS GHEC organization

## Organization settings

Edit the organization settings (settings tab when you are on the organization page)

1. Logo. If this is the organization for a science center or regional office, use https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/noaa_emblem_logo-2022.png  You will need to download and then upload this as a profile picture. If this if for a cross-office program or initiative, use the logo for that.
2. URL. Use the url to the office on fisheries.gov. For example, https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-regional-office
3. email. If your GitHub org has an email, include that here.
4. Description. If your organization has a `profile/README.md` file, then you can leave this blank. Otherwise include a short description like "GitHub organization and repositories from staff of the NWFSC" or "GitHub organization for the Fisheries Integrated Toolbox"

## Organization profile README

*Optional* If you create a  `.github` public repository within the organization and create a `README.md` file in a folder called `profile`, that markdown will appears when you go to the organization page. A link to create this will probably come up on the right side of your organization if you have not created this file yet.

Below is a template `README.md` file to be put in the  `.github/profile` folder.

```
# Full office name

short statement of what the org is for

admins or an email for the org

<hr>

Optional extra info for example links to popular repos or topic searches. You can also insert a table with the name, short description, and last commit of the repositories as seen in [this repo](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) (that isn't in GHEC) from staff at SWFSC and NWFSC.

Example:

See [here](https://github.com/noaa-S-T/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md) for an example of what the below code looks like as a README.md for the Office of Science and Technology (it does not appear on the organization page for noaa-S-T right now because there are other files in the .github repository other than the .profile/README.md file).

```
